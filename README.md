# MBG Extensions Library

## Intro

The MBG Extensions library is one of the first code libraries I ever published - back in 2010. It was hosted on CodePlex and since that has now been shut down, I have migrated the code here. Further details can be found on my CodeProject article here: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/116940/MBG-Extensions-Library
